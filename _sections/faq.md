  - question: What is an Unconference?
    answer: >
      It is all about the people An unconference has no speakers, no call for papers and no agenda in advance. All is made by attendees. The unconference starts with a big welcome and introduction game. The next step is asking for session inputs. Topics are greatly varied. There are two kind of sessions: interests and contributions. A contribution has a learning which is shared by the attendee. A smart topic which needs to be spread within community. An interest is a question by an attendee and the group is asked for input and their knowledge. You name the topic, we find the speaker. Topics can be hard like tech-topics in engineering or developing. But also soft like awareness of team movements, fast moving world topics or personal development. Sharing is caring! We all learn from each other. One of the key parts of the planning are the coffee breaks. During the sessions there are usually lovely conversations. Afterwards there is still time to exchange opinions and ideas.
  - question: Why only 100 attendees?
    answer: The larger the number of participants, the more anonymous the event. That's exactly what we don't want. We want a family atmosphere where everyone can and should participate in his or her own way. 
  - question: What's the difference between Community Ticket and Company Ticket?
    answer: >
      If you join as a private person, you are welcome to buy the Community Ticket. Companies need to buy Company Tickets. This helps us to make the self paid community tickets as affordable as possible.
  - question: Is food included?
    answer: Absolutly YES! During the Workshops on friday we will have some snacks and some drinks in the evening. On Suturday and Sunday we will have lunch together and also snacks with fruits, cakes and coffee afterwards. On Suturday evening we organized a dinner for all of us.
  - question: Who is organizing this event?
    answer: Besides us, the above mentioned organization team, this event was organized by the boot e.V. - Best of Open Technologies. The purpose of this association is the promotion of education, research and science in the field of open information and communication technology, in particular open source software. One main field is organizing several events within open source technologies. One event was the former PHPucEU – PHP Unconference Europe – and since 3 years we are happy to go together on with WEUC – Web Engineering Unconference. The activities are unpaid and we do not have commercial targets.

  - question: What is Jekyll?
    answer: > 
      Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.
  - question: What is front matter?
    answer: The front matter is where Jekyll starts to get really cool. Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines
  - question: What is a static file?
    answer: A static file is a file that does not contain any YAML front matter. These include images, PDFs, and other un-rendered content.
  - question: What is a collection?
    answer: Not everything is a post or a page. Maybe you want to document the various methods in your open source project, members of a team, or talks at a conference. Collections allow you to define a new type of document that behave like Pages or Posts do normally, but also have their own unique properties and namespace.
  - question: What is a data file?
    answer: In addition to the built-in variables available from Jekyll, you can specify your own custom data that can be accessed via the Liquid templating system. Jekyll supports loading data from YAML, JSON, and CSV files located in the  `_data` directory. Note that CSV files must contain a header row.
