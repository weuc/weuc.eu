  - question: What is an Unconference?
    answer: |
      It is all about the people. An unconference has no speakers, no call for papers and no agenda in advance. All is made by attendees. The unconference starts with a big welcome and introduction game. The next step is asking for session inputs and therefore topics are greatly varied.

      There are two kind of sessions: interests and contributions. A contribution has a learning which is shared by the attendee. A smart topic which needs to be spread within community. An interest is a question by an attendee and the group is asked for their knowledge. It goes like this: You name the topic, we find the speaker. Topics can be hard like tech-subjects in engineering or developing. But also soft like awareness of team movements, fast moving world topics or personal development. We all learn from each other. One of the key parts of the unconference are coffee breaks. Those time in between sessions give the opportunity to continue conversations from sessionsm, exchange opinions and ideas. Conclusion of an unconference: Sharing is caring!

  - question: Why only 100 attendees?
    answer: |
      The larger the number of participants, the more anonymous the event. That's exactly what we don't want. We want a family atmosphere where everyone can and should participate in his or her own way. 

  - question: What's the difference between Community Ticket and Company Ticket?
    answer: |
      If you join as a private person, you are welcome to buy the Community Ticket. Companies need to buy Company Tickets. This helps us to make the self paid community tickets as affordable as possible.

  - question: Is food included?
    answer: |
      Absolutly YES! During the Workshops on friday we will have some snacks and a sundowner in the evening. On Suturday and Sunday we will have lunch together and also snacks with fruits, cakes and coffee afterwards. On Suturday evening we organized a dinner for all of us. The only occasion where we don' t serve food is the cocktail event on Friday evening.

       - question: Will their be some spare time for sightseeing?
    answer: |
       Palma is worth visiting, that´s a fact. Specially if you are into urban cities, spanish history and contemporary art - than you should plan one or two additional days. Once the unconferece has startet, time flies away and we assume that you will have not the time for sightseeing. 
        - question: Will their be some time to go to the beach?
    answer: |
       For a short swim in the sea, yes - for a long day at the beach, no. If you would love to combine beach and unconference, we recommend to plan one additional day.
