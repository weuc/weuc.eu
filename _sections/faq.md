  - question: What is an Unconference?
    answer: >
      It is all about the people An unconference has no speakers, no call for papers and no agenda in advance. All is made by attendees. The unconference starts with a big welcome and introduction game. The next step is asking for session inputs. Topics are greatly varied. There are two kind of sessions: interests and contributions. A contribution has a learning which is shared by the attendee. A smart topic which needs to be spread within community. An interest is a question by an attendee and the group is asked for input and their knowledge. You name the topic, we find the speaker. Topics can be hard like tech-topics in engineering or developing. But also soft like awareness of team movements, fast moving world topics or personal development. Sharing is caring! We all learn from each other. One of the key parts of the planning are the coffee breaks. During the sessions there are usually lovely conversations. Afterwards there is still time to exchange opinions and ideas.
  - question: Why only 100 attendees?
    answer: The larger the number of participants, the more anonymous the event. That's exactly what we don't want. We want a family atmosphere where everyone can and should participate in his or her own way. 
  - question: What's the difference between Community Ticket and Company Ticket?
    answer: >
      If you join as a private person, you are welcome to buy the Community Ticket. Companies need to buy Company Tickets. This helps us to make the self paid community tickets as affordable as possible.
