  - question: What is an Unconference?
    answer: |
      It is all about the people. An unconference has no speakers, no call for papers and no agenda in advance. All is made by attendees. The unconference starts with a big welcome and introduction game. The next step is asking for session inputs and therefore topics are greatly varied. There are two kinds of sessions: interests and contributions. A contribution has a learning which is shared by the attendee. A smart topic which needs to be spread within community. An interest is a question by an attendee and the group is asked for their knowledge. It goes like this: You name the topic, we find the speaker. Topics can be hard like tech-subjects in engineering or developing. But also soft like awareness of team movements, fast moving world topics or personal development. We all learn from each other. One of the key parts of the unconference are coffee breaks. Those time in between sessions give the opportunity to continue conversations from sessions, exchange opinions and ideas. Conclusion of an unconference: Sharing is caring!
      
  - question: Why it takes place on an island? What about flight emissions? 
    answer: |
       We are aware that we cause more emissions by traveling to Mallorca than if we were looking for a location on the mainland. But we have appreciated the Mediterranean atmosphere of the island for years and would not want to miss it. But through our sponsoring package "CO2 Compensation" we will offset a considerable part of the issue financially. We will let you know shortly which project we will support.

  - question: Does it fit if I bring my family with children? 
    answer: |
       Naturally! Our event is open to the families of our community and looks forward to a lot of partners as well as children. We are happy to offer a leisure program if there are more than 10 partners and more than 10 children.
          
  - question: Why only 100 attendees?
    answer: |
      The larger the number of participants, the more anonymous the event. That's exactly what we don't want. We want a family atmosphere where everyone can and should participate in his or her own way. 

  - question: Is food included?
    answer: |
      Absolutely YES! On Saturday and Sunday we will have lunch together and also snacks with fruits, cakes and coffee afterwards. On Saturday evening we organized a dinner for all of us. The only occasion where we don't serve food is the cocktail event on Friday evening.
      
  - question: Who is organizing this event?
    answer: |
      Besides those friendly faces in the people section, this event operator is boot e.V. - Best of Open Technologies. The purpose of this association is the promotion of education, research and science in the field of open information and communication technology, in particular open source software. One main field is organizing several events within open source technologies. One event was the former PHPucEU – PHP Unconference Europe – and since 4 years we are happy to go together on with WEUC – Web Engineering Unconference. Our work in organization and other fields are unpaid and we do not have commercial targets.

  - question: Will there be some spare time for sightseeing?
    answer: |
       Palma is worth visiting, that’s a fact. Especially if you are into urban cities, Spanish history and contemporary art - than you should plan one or two additional days. Once the unconference has started, time flies away, and we assume that you will have not the time for sightseeing. 

  - question: Will there be some time to go to the beach?
    answer: |
       For a short swim in the sea, yes - for a long day at the beach, no. If you love to combine beach and unconference, we recommend planning one additional day.  
       
  - question: How do I stay informed about news and facts? 
    answer: |
