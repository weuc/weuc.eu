      How can we design a system that delivers ultra-fresh produce from local farms to customers – without central warehouses, unnecessary delays, or wasteful detours?

      In this interactive, hands-on workshop where we’ll collaboratively explore and model the innovative operations of "Produce Paradise," a fictitious startup reimagining farm-to-table delivery.

      This workshop isn’t about applying one “big name” method. Instead, we’ll combine and adapt techniques such as Domain Storytelling, Event Storming, or Example Mapping - plus any approaches you bring from your own experience.

      Starting from real-world raw materials like scribbles, emails, transcripts, and business plans we will understand the story and context. We will then collaboratively map out the logistics journey, identify pain points, and brainstorm solutions using a hybrid of collaborative modeling techniques.

      This is a workshop for software developers and everybody else involved solving business problems. No prior experience with modeling methods required, just curiosity and a willingness to co-create.

      "Let’s just do a workshop on that!" – That’s easy to say, but not so easy to do. Workshops can – and should – be much more than just a meeting; they're not only about exchanging information, but above all about truly understanding topics, making concrete decisions for implementation, and translating the first steps into action and learning.

      To make workshops truly effective and sustainable, there are a few things to keep in mind: What information, skills, and attitude should be conveyed? How do I get the attention and engagement of the participants? How do I deal with disruptions?

      In about 3 hours, we’ll talk with you about the following topics:

      - Goals & clarifying expectations
      - Phases of a workshop
      - Forms of participation
      - Decision-making formats
      - Timekeeping
      - Dealing with disruptions
