about: |
  Catch up with an enthusiastic group of like minded people who are crazy about web technologies and performance. No matter if you are an Engineer, DevOps, Architect, Product Owner or Project Manager - everybody is welcome.

  This event is very open and at the same time exclusive. The maximum number of attendees is limited to 100. We want a family atmosphere where everyone can engage in sharing their knowledge and experience. It's like a weekend with friends and everyone brought their laptops :-) Plus, it's on the beautiful island of Mallorca in late summer. Usually the weather is perfect to relax at the pool and have a good time with friends.
