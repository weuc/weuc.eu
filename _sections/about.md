about: Catch up with an enthusiastic group of likeminded people who are crazy about web technologies and performance. No matter if you are an Engineer, DevOps, Architect, Product Owner or Project Manager - everybody is welcome. This event is very open and inclusive. The maximum number of attendees is limited to 100. We want a family atmosphere where everyone can engage in sharing their knowledge and experience. It's like a weekend with friends and everyone brought their laptops :-) Plus, it's on the beautiful island of Mallorca in late summer. Usually he weather is perfect to relax at the pool and have a good time with friends.
