    **Why it takes place on an island? What about flight emissions?**

    We are aware that we cause more emissions by traveling to Mallorca than if we were looking for a location on the mainland. But we have appreciated the Mediterranean atmosphere of the island for years and would not want to miss it. But through our sponsoring package "CO2 Compensation" we will offset a considerable part of the issue financially.
