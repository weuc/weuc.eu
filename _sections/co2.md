    **Why it takes place on an island? What about flight emissions?**

    We know that traveling to Mallorca generates more emissions than choosing a mainland location. The Mediterranean atmosphere of the island is something we’ve valued for years, and we don’t want to miss it. However, we can only address the CO₂ emissions through our “CO₂ Compensation” sponsorship package - if we find a sponsor to support it. Without one, we can’t implement the compensation.
