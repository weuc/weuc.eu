    **Why it takes place on an island? What about flight emissions?**

    We are aware that we cause more emissions by traveling to Mallorca than if we were looking for a location on the mainland. But we have appreciated the Mediterranean atmosphere of the island for years and would not want to miss it. But through our sponsoring package "CO2 Compensation" we will offset a considerable part of the issue financially.
    
    WeUC extends a big thank you to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.innogames.com/de/">InnoGames</a> for supporting the project of the Mallorca Preservation Foundation through their CO2 Package.<br>
    By doing so, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.innogames.com/de/">InnoGames</a> is helping to offset our carbon footprint, contributing to the preservation of Mallorcaâ€™s natural environment. Their commitment not only enhances our efforts toward sustainability but also inspires others in the industry to take meaningful actions for a greener future. <br>
    We are proud to partner with organizations like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.innogames.com/de/">InnoGames</a>, whose values align with our mission for a more sustainable and responsible tech community.<br><br>
